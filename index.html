	<h2><b>About Me</b></h2>
	<p style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">Hi, Welcome to my Website! The above slide show has images of every country I have lived in. 
		I was born in the Coventry, United Kingdom on March 19th 2000 after my parents moved there from Ferrol, Spain. 
		We moved to London shortly after that and lived there until 2010. During the summer of 2010 we moved to Tashkent, 
		Uzbekistan where we lived for over 2 years before moving to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in January of 2013. 
		My family lived in Rio for three years and in the summer of 2016 we moved back to the UK where I graduated from high school (Sixth Form) 
		with my IB diploma at Dartford Grammar School. I then moved to Davenport, Iowa in the United States to pursue a BSc in Computer Science 
		and a BA in International Business at St. Ambrose University (GO BEES!). I graduated from St. Ambrose on May 21st 2022 with both degrees and a 3.4 GPA.
		Right out of college I was recruited by Moody's Corporation to join their Technology Rotation program (MATR) as an Associate Software Engineer.
		I'm incredibly grateful for this opportunity and I'm excited to learn and develop my skills to become a better software engineer.

	<p style"font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">Thanks to moving around so much growing up, I learnt how to speak several languages. 
		At home my family speaks Spanish, however growing up in the UK I learnt how to speak English too, hence my fluency in both languages. 
		When we moved to Uzbekistan we learnt Russian as the country is a former state of the USSR. 
		Throughout my time in London and Tashkent my parents had me take French classes, which is why I have an intermediate level grasp on both Russian and French. 
		Finally in Rio we learnt how to speak Portuguese. Being pretty similar to Spanish, Portuguese was easy to learn and I became fluent pretty quickly</p>
